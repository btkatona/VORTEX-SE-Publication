A collection of compiled CM1 code, initialization soundings, namelists, and terrain fields to replicate the data used in Katona et al. (2021). 


cm1r19_VSE -- source code for the version of George Bryan's CM1 used for this study. It is version 19 release 4.

namelist.input.vse -- sample namelist for running the experiments in Katona et al. (2021). 

perts.dat -- Terrain file ised in the VSE CM1 experiments.

input_sounding_20170405_final  -- Input sounding used for the SW flow experiment 

input_sounding_20180318_final -- Input sounding used for the S flow experiment

input_sounding_BMX_20170405_hrrr -- Area averaged sounding derived from the HRRR for the SW flow experiment. Sounding was subjectively modified to produce the one marked final above

input_sounding_BMX_20180318_hrrr -- Area averaged sounding derived from the HRRR for the S flow experiment. Sounding was subjectively modified to produce the one marked final above
